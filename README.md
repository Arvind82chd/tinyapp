# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

This project has a register and login page to access its contents and services. Each user can generate, edit and delete short URLs against each long url provided by them. The users can access other users short urls if they know them but can not delete or edit them.
